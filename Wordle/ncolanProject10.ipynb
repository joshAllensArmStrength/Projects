    "Wordle is a simple $5$ x $6$ grid based puzzle game that challenges the player to find the correct five-letter word in six guesses. To help the player guess the correct word within the six alloted guesses, the game will give a letter by letter feedback for each guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a letter's grid is colored `gray`, that means that letter does not appear in the puzzle's answer. If a letter's grid is colored `yellow`, that means that the letter does appear in the puzzle's answer, but it is currently not in the correct position. And if a letter's grid is colored `green`, that letter appears in the puzzle's answer in that same position. The puzzle is thereby solved when every letter tile is colored `green`.\n",

    "In this project we will analyze every possible word that can appear in this iteration of Wordle, and see how different starting word guesses affect the number of guesses needed to solve the Wordle puzzle.\n",
