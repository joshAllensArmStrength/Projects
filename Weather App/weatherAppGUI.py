This will be the GUI section of our weather app. It will feature a 'home' page, where the user will be able to enter a city/town or a zip code, and the weekly forecast will then be displayed under the 'weekly forecast screen'. From this screen, the user will also be able to click onto a specific day, and will be brought to a new 'daily forecast' screen. This 'daily forecast' screen will show a more detailed look at the forecast for that day.
